# About 

Here's a somewhat random and super incomplete assortment of questions and interests of mine.

## Questions

- What dynamics govern our psyche? What is its structure? In what language can this best be described and with what tools best investigated?

- What does our psyche look like in 10,000 years?
    - Our brains (and bodies) are machines that overlay our present with experiences from the past (ours, and those of thousands of generations before us). How malleable is this?
    - How basic are human experiences such as love, freedom, agency, trust, identity, death, joy, grief, resistance, letting go, ...?

- Why do all humans form an ego, when most animals seem not to?

- What is a thought? How do thoughts vary across people? (How) Do animals think?

- What are mental illnesses?

- Why and how do talking cures (e.g., modern psychotherapy) work?
    - Why are talking cures so limited and fail so often?
    - What instruments could help us better understand the mechanisms at play?

- How can we enable scientific progress while averting dangerous outcomes? See, e.g., [A Vision of Metascience](https://scienceplusplus.org/metascience/) and [Can We Survive Technology](https://sseh.uchicago.edu/doc/von_Neumann_1955.pdf).

- Why, after >100 years, is there no consensus on the interpretation of quantum mechanics?

- How does the brain work?
    - How does learning show up in the brain?
    - How are memories formed and retrieved?
    - Why is the information throughput of a human brain limited to [~10 bits per second](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10234)?
